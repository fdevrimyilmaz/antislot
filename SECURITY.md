# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest `main` branch and the latest release are supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security reports. Use GitHub Security
Advisories (private vulnerability reporting) if available. If the repository
is hosted elsewhere, contact the maintainers through a private channel.

## Disclosure

We will coordinate a fix and release before public disclosure whenever possible.
